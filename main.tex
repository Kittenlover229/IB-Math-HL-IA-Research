\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Rationale}
Not longer than two days ago I was challenged to a mathematical standoff by a 
good friend of mine, the battlefield would be polynomial functions and their 
graphs. Winning this competition was a matter of honor, so I used all of my 
skill and wits to prepare. The fight would be held in \mbox{"Graph Wars"}, a 
small competitive 1v1 game published on the 23rd of February 2022. 

The goal of the game is to design a function that can be plotted from one point
to another without intersecting any circles faster than your opponent. This
is wrapped into a war-like setting where your function is a projectile, directed
by your soldiers against your common foes.

It is also usually played without assistance of any external programs like 
graph plotters or calculators, that's for good reason. The game is considered
solved: for any initial state of the field there can be deduced a function to
guarantee a "hit". 

\subsection{Aim}
I as a human can see a set of points the function would need to go through 
in order to avoid colliding with anything on it's way. My ultimate goal 
would simply be to design an algorithm, which when given a set of points, 
would express the path to go through them as a polynomial.
